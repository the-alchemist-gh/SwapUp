A product/service swapping platform that facilitate exchanging goods & services by helping people recycle used/new products they don't need for products/services they need.

## Functionalities
I created a fake API which is used on heroku.

In the MVP, the following are the current functionalities- :

### - `Click the Add Item button to add a new product or service to the list`

### - `Search for an Item/service using the search bar`

### - `Filter through by category by clicking on a particular category`

### - `Click the love icon to like an item`

### - `Click the Item title/name to view details of Item`

### - `View count increases when Item details is viewed`

### - `View number of offers available on a particular item`

### - `Click View Offers to view all offers made for an item`

### - `Page redirects when Item is added`
